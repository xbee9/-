# ADBHUT (ADBHUT) - ADB Over Network Automation Script

A powerful and interactive Bash script to manage Android devices over a network using ADB (Android Debug Bridge). This tool allows users to connect to Android devices via IP, push/pull files, install APKs, run shell commands, scan subnets for ADB-enabled devices, and more — all from a terminal interface with a colored UI and logging.

## 📌 Features

- **Automatic ADB Installation Check**
- **Interactive IP Connection Interface**
- **Push/Pull Files and Install APKs**
- **Run Custom ADB Shell Commands**
- **Scan Subnets for ADB-Enabled Devices**
- **Batch Mode for Multiple IPs**
- **Logs All Device Info and Actions**
- **Graceful Exit on Interrupt Signal (Ctrl+C)**

## 🧰 Prerequisites

- Linux (Ubuntu/Debian tested)
